        <p>At some point (hopefully in the near future) this website will allow you to catalog your favourite recipes, share them with friends, and discover new recipes.</p>
        <p>Recipe Ninja is being designed around a simple recommendation engine built as a proof of concept using <a href="https://neo4j.com/" class="border-b border-black border-dashed">Neo4j</a>. As soon as you've started cataloging your recipes, you will be able to search for the right recipe based on what ingredients you have available, and when you get bored of your own recipes you can always nab one of your friends or families.</p>
        <p>This is a side project so there is no guarantee as to when something functional will be available. In the meantime feel free to follow the development of Recipe Ninja over at <a href="https://github.com/RecipeNinja/recipe.ninja" class="border-b border-black border-dashed">GitHub</a></p>
